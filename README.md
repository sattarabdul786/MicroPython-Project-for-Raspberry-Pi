# MicroPython-Project-for-Raspberry-Pi
MicroPython is a tiny open source Python programming language interpretor that runs on small embedded development boards. With MicroPython you can write clean and simple Python code to control hardware instead of having to use complex low-level languages like C or C++ (what Arduino uses for programming).
